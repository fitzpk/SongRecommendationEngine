# Song Recommendation Engine

**Created in collaboration with Ken Duthie**

This project utilizes the Turicreate Python library to create an item-content similarity recommender. To train and test the recommender, a local library of 10,005 songs was used. Audio metrics and metadata information for each song was then extracted using librosa and tiny tag respectively. For a full list of features, please see below.

Features:
- duration of album on which the song appeared
- song duration
- year released
- genre
- audio offset
- bitrate
- sample rate
- tempo
- tuning
- zero crossing rate
- spectral centroid
- spectral bandwidth
- spectral rolloff
- chroma frequency

**Visuals (just for fun)**
A <a href="https://fitzpk.github.io/SongRecommendationEngine/artistnetwork.html">D3 visualization</a> was created with the concept that user's should be able to see how their recommended artists are connected.
